Some other topics which make my curiosity vein tinkle are: decision making in online settings, reinforcement learning, transfer and continual learning.\nPreviously I was doing my master thesis, entitled \u0026ldquo;Gaussian Processes for Automatic Optimization of Spinal Electrical Stimulation\u0026rdquo;, in the G-Lab also at EPFL. While doing my Biochemistry bachelor I accompained a biological modelling group and did an internship at the Blue Brain Project.\nMy background involves neuroscience, engineering and computer science. I love to understand how things work and see how deep the rabbit hole is, nevertheless, translating such knowledge into a useful working application is also very rewarding.\nCorrespondence: Second Name at protonmail\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://Abranchini.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am an intern @LIONS at EPFL, Switzerland, in the group led by Prof. Volkan Cevher.
