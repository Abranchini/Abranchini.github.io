My main responsabilities lie in automating the search, regarding the stimulation protocols used in the project of .Neurorestore where we deal with spinal cord injury patients, by employing intelligent decision making systems. Until now, my academic journey was definitly not a straight path. Currently, I am focusing on Bayesian optimization (BO) and its applications. Nevertheless, I am also interested in understanding theoretical properties of the models we currently use.\nMy background involves neuroscience, engineering and computer science. I love to understand how things work and see how deep the rabbit hole is!\nCorrespondence: Second Name at protonmail","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://Abranchini.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I finished my second year of PhD at EPFL in the Laboratory for Information and Inference Systems led by Prof. Volkan Cevher and .Neurorestore center led by Prof. Grégoire Courtine and Prof.","tags":null,"title":"Pedro Abranches de Carvalho","type":"authors"},{"authors":["Igor Krawczuk","Pedro Abranches","Andreas Loukas","Volkan Cevher"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1616273762,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616273762,"objectID":"9412935dd877c80070f942660f63250f","permalink":"https://Abranchini.github.io/publication/gggan/","publishdate":"2021-03-20T22:56:02+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/gggan/","section":"publication","summary":"We study the fundamental problem of graph generation. Specifically, we treat graph generation from a geometric perspective by associating each node with a position in space and then connecting the edges based on a similarity function. We then provide new solutions to the key challenges that prevent the widespread application of this classical geometric interpretation: (1) modeling complex relations, (2) modeling isomorphic graphs consistently, and (3) fully exploiting the latent distribution. Our main contribution is dubbed as the geometric graph (GG) generative adversarial network (GAN), which is a Wasserstein GAN that addresses the above challenges. GG-GAN is permutation equivariant and easily scales to generate graphs of tens of thousands of nodes. GG-GAN also strikes a good trade-off between novelty and modeling the distribution statistics, being competitive or surpassing the state-of-the-art methods that are either slower or that are non-equivariant, or that exploit problem-specific knowledge.","tags":[],"title":"GG-GAN: A Geometric Graph Generative Adversarial Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rui DM Travasso","Fernando Sampaio dos Aidos","Anahita Bayani","Pedro Abranches","Armindo Salvador"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1590008162,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590008162,"objectID":"dcd4777905395a719b37251e96fac5f0","permalink":"https://Abranchini.github.io/publication/localized-redox-relays-as-a-privileged-mode-of-cytoplasmic-hydrogen-peroxide-signaling/","publishdate":"2020-05-20T22:56:02+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/localized-redox-relays-as-a-privileged-mode-of-cytoplasmic-hydrogen-peroxide-signaling/","section":"publication","summary":"Published in Redox Biology","tags":[],"title":"Localized Redox Relays as a Privileged Mode of Cytoplasmic Hydrogen Peroxide Signaling","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1590002347,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590002347,"objectID":"507bcccc98a3b4521784e6f26edc578b","permalink":"https://Abranchini.github.io/project/fmri/","publishdate":"2020-05-20T21:19:07+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/fmri/","section":"project","summary":"Trying to infer a weak causality between activations in the brain using fMRI data (project started in class in need of a final finishing blow)","tags":["Machine Learning"],"title":"Causal Brain","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1590000744,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590000744,"objectID":"b87c2bc94ca699b55ead1d5171bfadf0","permalink":"https://Abranchini.github.io/project/pandora/","publishdate":"2020-05-20T20:52:24+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/pandora/","section":"project","summary":"There is much I do not know starting my PhD journey.
